Scikit-learn is a machine learning library in Python that is used by many data science practitioners. In this training, we will learn about model evaluation, model calibration, and model inspection. For model evaluation, we will compare various metrics such as ROC AUC and mean average precision and see how they behave on datasets with different characteristics. We will use scikit-learn's plotting API to easily visualize the performance of a model and to compare multiple models. A well-calibrated model will predict probabilities that reflect the true likelihood of an event. Next, we will learn about techniques used for inspecting open-box machine learning models after they are trained. Afterwards, we will learn about inspection techniques used for more opaque models such as random forests or gradient boosted trees. These techniques are flexible because they can be applied to any machine learning model and gives a glimpse into how the model is generating its predictions.
